# Fast-AMPs-Discovery-Projects
This is a new lightweight DL pipeline by using the currently largest scale of physicochemical descriptors. Unlike multiple model hybrids, our framework was lightweight and we mathematically designed a new self-attention module for the first time, potentially avoiding risks of overfitting.
By open and implement the document Training.py, you can directly utilize it to train and predict potential AMPs, the details are written in utils.py.

Due to the size limitations of physiochemical descriptors of all sequences, the npy containing these dataset were not submitted to github. For convenience, you can calculate it by codes provided in Training1.py. This process usually need 10 hours if you implement it on your normal laptop.
