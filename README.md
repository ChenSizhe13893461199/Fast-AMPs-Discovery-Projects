# Fast-AMPs-Discovery-Projects
This is a new lightweight DL pipeline by using the currently largest scale of physicochemical descriptors. Unlike multiple model hybrids, our framework was lightweight and mathematically designed a new self-attention module for the first time, potentially avoiding risks of overfitting.
By open and implement the document Training.py, you can directly utilize it to train and predict potential AMPs, the details are written in utils.py.
